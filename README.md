# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Requirement analysis involves collecting, examining, and defining what a software system should do. Its main goal is to ensure all stakeholders clearly understand the system’s purpose and expected behavior.


# What is Requirement Analysis?
It's the process of identifying and analyzing the system's needs.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Ensures clear understanding among stakeholders
- Defines the project scope
- Guides design and development
- Supports cost and time estimation
- Helps maintain quality


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Requirement Gathering - Collecting requirements using various techniques.
- Requirement Elicitation - Identifying stakeholders’ true needs and expectations.
- Requirement Documentation - Recording the collected requirements.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling - Refining and representing requirements using models like use cases.
- Requirement Validation - Confirming with stakeholders that all requirements meet their needs.

# Types of Requirements.
- Functional Requirement - Describe what the system must do to meet user needs.
- Non-Function Requirement - Define how the system should perform to ensure quality.

# Use Case Diagrams.
- Use case diagrams visually show how the system functions and how users (actors) interact with it to achieve their goals.
