# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Requirement Gathering - gathering requirement through different gathering methods.
- Requirement Elicitation - The process of discovering the actual needs and expectations of stakeholders.
- Requirement Documentation - The process of documenting gathered requirement.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling - Refining requirements and drawing usecase models to visualize how the system works.
